movie_api (myFlix):

OVERVIEW:
The movie_api is the server-side component of a web application that provides users with information about movies, directors, and genres. Users can create accounts, manage their profiles, and curate a list of their favorite movies. Built using the MERN stack, the API follows REST architecture principles, offering secure and efficient access to movie-related data stored in a non-relational database. The application demonstrates proficiency in backend development, including server frameworks, database management, authentication, authorization, and data security.
